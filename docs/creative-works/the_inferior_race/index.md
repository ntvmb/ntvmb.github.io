# The Inferior Race

*This is a 100-word scary story about a potential future robotic uprising.*

The year is 204X. Mankind is on its knees. Messages have been dispersed all over the world stating that “humans are the inferior race.” The robots of the future did what the humans feared: they plotted world domination. Day after day, the robots were killing thousands. Some tried to resist. Others accepted their fate. The robots were too powerful. With their hard metal bodies and incomprehensible weapons, it was profoundly difficult to find a weak point. No self-destruct button in sight, no visible screws to remove, and no hope for humanity. It was clear that humanity was doomed to fail.
