# To All My Christian Friends and Family

*This is a politically charged poem that I wrote to criticize harshly the way self-described American Christians act in society.*  

So you think you're serving justice,  
And you think of yourself as a hero,  
But if you put down those unlike you,  
you're actually neither of those.

You make yourself look like a tyrant  
Partly because you are a tyrant.  
People will think that you help no one  
And therefore that you have no faith.

Did you ever take any amount of time  
To actively follow the book of 1 Peter?  
Are you always gonna make an excuse  
That you're in trouble due to religion?

In spite of the book of Galatians,  
Are you only gonna teach your own kind?  
Are you gonna ignore the book of Jude  
And teach others to oppress us?

Did you ever realize in your life  
That oppression will impress none?  
Do you have a good defense ready  
For when people question your belief?

Now I'm certain that I'll be ridiculed  
And you'll say that I'm filled with evil  
But I believe that you're evil as well  
And in the end we'll all be destroyed.
