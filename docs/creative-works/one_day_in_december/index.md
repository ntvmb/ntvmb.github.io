# One Day in December

*This poem was written to commemorate the anniversary of the Western Kentucky EF4 tornado that occurred on December 10th, 2021. This one was fun to write and is one of my favorites.*

Mayfield, Kentucky–  
A small but beautiful city  
With ten thousand residents  
And cold winters of precedence. 

But one day in December  
A twister brought terror–  
An unusual happening  
Destroying many buildings.

Debris was lofted around  
It tore through the ground.  
What a monster it had been–  
The likes we’ve never seen!

Some homes were swept  
And some people wept.  
The winds were so strong  
Carrying things along.

The response was quick  
But the twister burnt out the wick.  
Now it wasn’t all that cold  
But some would still fold.
