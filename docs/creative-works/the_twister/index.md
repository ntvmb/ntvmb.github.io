# The Twister

*This is an ode to the National Weather Service. It shows gratitude for the work they do to prevent loss of life in natural disaters, particularly tornadoes.*

The atmosphere is unstable  
So the forecast calls for storms.  
Storms begin to brew  
And are then seen on radar.

The storms are getting stronger;  
Now a warning is heard on TV and radio.  
The time to act is now;  
Itâ€™s time to head to the basement.

Then the roar of wind is heard;  
The roar resembles that of a lion.  
Everything above ground is destroyed  
In a matter of seconds.

A gray funnel cloud  
Surrounded by debris  
Carves a path of destruction  
All throughout the town.

After the twister passes  
Thousands of lives  
That may have perished  
Will have been saved.  

The town will lay in ruin  
But the National Weather Service  
Will have done its job correctly  
To save the lives of many.
