# Every Moment

*This poem was written for Thanksgiving. It primarily revolves around gratitude, family, and my own philosophical reflections.*

Every moment that led up to this point  
From the moment I emerged from the womb  
To the moment that is occurring right now  
Has its reasons to be appreciated.

Every moment when there was trouble  
Every moment when there was a struggle  
I may not look back on with fondness  
But I understand it made me stronger.

Every moment when I was oppressed  
I knew my family was there for me  
And I was there for my family  
Even through our own political conflicts.

Every moment that I ever witnessed  
I always thought to myself  
That there’s no one I’d rather be  
Than my own self in my own body.

Every moment occurring in the future  
From now until the day I die  
Though I know it will never be certain  
I will find something to appreciate.
