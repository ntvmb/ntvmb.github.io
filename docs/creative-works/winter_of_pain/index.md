# Winter of Pain

*This is a poem about how a snowy day can quickly become painful and dangerous if things don't go as planned. Based on a true story.*

The day began like any other day  
And for the seven hours I was at school  
The snow was constantly falling  
But school carried on without a fuss.

As soon as the school was dismissed  
The snow brought with it a sour twist:  
I waited and waited for the bus  
But no bus had departed since I came.

So I walked a mile to my home  
While it was twenty degrees Fahrenheit.  
It was not like a walk in the park  
Unless said walk was also long and cold.

That day proved to be agonizing  
But I have endured a Winter of pain.  
Yet there is not a single Winter  
That has been endured by everyone.[^death]

[^death]: The last two lines are also a subtle reference to the fact that, later that same day, I heard that my paternal grandfather had died.
