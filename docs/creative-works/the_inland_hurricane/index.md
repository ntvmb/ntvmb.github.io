# The Inland Hurricane

*This is a poem illustrating a setup and the destructive effects of a derecho—a widespread, long-lived, straight-line wind storm that is usually quite powerful.*

The summer heat is brutal;  
People look for ways to beat it.  
But while they might not be aware of it  
Mother Nature has them covered.

At first it cannot be seen  
But Mother Nature has a plan.  
She begins to carefully craft  
A setup unlike most.

They call it the Ring of Fire  
And forecasters hate it.  
Because it’s difficult to tell  
What Mother Nature is planning.

Although it’s uncertain  
Forecasters call for storms anyway.  
But those storms are not expected  
To be typical summer storms.

Storms fire up in the Midwest  
In an unsurprising manner.  
But it will soon become apparent  
That these storms don’t mess around.

The distinct linear shape  
And intensity of the storms  
Give us an impression  
That these aren’t ordinary storms.

The wind blows like a hurricane  
And the dark clouds turn day into night  
While the pouring rain makes it hard  
To see what is around you.

Trees are down and the power is out  
In an area that’s a hundred miles wide.  
And some homes are too weak  
To survive the wrath of the storms.

It’s as if a gigantic twister  
Or an inland hurricane  
Tore through the area.  
Though some people prefer

That you call it a derecho.  
But unlike hurricanes  
When you realize you’re in its path  
It might be too late to escape.

So when storms are forecast  
Just keep in mind that  
Whenever conditions are right  
The storms may not be so boring.
