# The Sudden Darkness

*This is a short story I wrote to show something interesting I witnessed during a road trip.*  
*Note: This story is **not** intended to down-play the work of the National Weather Service, despite me referring to the agency in a negative connotation. Real meteorologists are working at the agency, and as they are human they too make mistakes sometimes.*

It was a July day unlike most to me and my family. We were on the road hometown to see extended family. Suddenly the skies became dark, and the rain picked up. We drove into a thunderstorm. I looked at my radar. The bureaucrats were not concerned about the storm. But I felt that it could’ve dropped a tornado at any moment.

As we slowly crept through the storm, the bureaucrats still felt no concern. So many things could have happened. There could have been a tornado. Somebody could have crashed. But everything turned out okay. Only after we exited the storm did the bureaucrats become concerned enough to issue a severe thunderstorm warning. Still, everyone made it out okay, and there was no tornado. However, it was never a matter of if a tornado would occur, but a matter of when. It wasn’t over us, but those behind us weren’t so lucky.
