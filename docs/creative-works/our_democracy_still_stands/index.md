# Our Democracy Still Stands

*This is an inaugural poem I wrote to express what I wanted to see in the future of the United States. Some statements may not accurately reflect my current feelings.*

I know our democracy has been threatened  
I know our politics are as polarizing as ever  
But all I want to see is progress.  
Progress in the right direction:  
Progress towards equality  
Progress towards justice  
And progress towards a better America.  
It will be a challenge  
A challenge to give people living wages  
A challenge to care for the people  
A challenge to support a good cause.  
These aren’t challenges we can’t curb.  
We’ve been through tough challenges already:  
We fought to end slavery  
We fought to give everyone the right to vote  
We fought to protect our right to vote  
But most importantly  
We fought for our freedoms.  
In spite of these challenges  
Our democracy still stands.
