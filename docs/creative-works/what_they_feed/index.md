# What They Feed

What was long warned by intellectuals--  
Attempts to make tyranny perpetual--  
An irrational public didn't heed,  
So now through violence they feed.

Regarding what it is they feed,  
They don't choose anyone in need,  
Nor anyone who did the required deed  
To attain entitlement of being freed.

For all for whom imprisonment is unjust,  
Their fear feeds the tyrant's lust.  
Instead of being a great protector,  
They are instead a mere spectre.

They feed the lifestyles of the elite,  
all of whom they're scared to defeat.  
Instead of having themselves a treat,  
They choose to become the tyrant's meat.

They declared their liberties once,  
Yet now they all sound like a dunce.  
They become stuck in their trance  
While the tyrants continue to dance.

They are demonized against their will  
And will have no help if they fall ill.  
They see this big, beautiful bill,  
But it really fuels the angry drill.

Yet our grievances are forever loud,  
Drawing to the streets a huge crowd--  
Displaying an endless stream of hope  
That lies beyond the tyrant's scope.
