## No. 1

In a thunderstorm  
I’m inside as I should be,  
hearing its roaring.

## No. 2

Leaves on the trees fall  
after summer says goodbye  
so we see the change.

## No. 3

Snowflakes are falling  
bringing excitement to kids  
who are quite playful.

## No. 4

Trees in October  
begin to become lifeless  
and make way for frights.

## No. 5

The blue sky remains  
ever so bright all year long  
and shows us all life.

## No. 6

The grass remains green  
but the tree leaves are now red  
and are scattered 'round.

## No. 7

When November comes  
the landscape becomes quiet  
letting Winter in.

## No. 8

I walk out the door  
to find a hint of red in  
the trees and landscape.

## No. 9

While standing outside  
I see the leaves have frosted  
but its tree has not.

## No. 10

The wind brings the chills  
yet it's still not cold enough  
to start seeing snow.

## No. 11

Thought it was warmer  
but by five the sun had set;  
'twas a brutal night.

## No. 12

Winter came early;  
it's much colder than normal.  
Earth's always crazy.

## No. 13

The stroke of midnight--  
we acknowledge the passage  
of time and our lives.

## No. 14[^bsky]

Summer's blazing heat  
came so early I could not  
believe it was May.

## No. 15
During Summer rain  
I'm reminded of certain  
Japanese legends.
